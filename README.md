# advent-of-code

- Day 1: I revised reading data from files and list comprehension (not best practise...?)
- Day 2: Using a matrix (numpy array) to store data, retrieving data
- Day 3 and 4: More list comprehension. Used a loop in Day 4, as well as finding intersection of two ranges.
- Day 5: Using more loops and first example of regex.
- Day 6: More loops. Chonky solution, could have used better list comprehension. Not sure about speed?
- Day 7: More loops and conditional statements. Pretty happy with this one.
